#
# Made with ❤️
#
# This project is genuinely built on love, dedication, and care.
# Fin exists not only as a compiler, but as a labor of passion —
# created for a lover, inspired by curiosity, perseverance, and belief
# in building something meaningful from the ground up.
#
# “What is made with love is never made in vain.”
# “Love is the reason this code exists; logic is how it survives.”
